    import_mesh(filename = nothing; dim=3)

Open `filename` and create a [`Mesh`](@ref) from the `gmsh` model in it.

If `filename` is `nothing`, the current `gmsh` model is used. Note that this
assumes that the *Gmsh* API has been initialized through `gmsh.initialize`.

Passing `dim=2` will create a two-dimensional mesh by projecting the original
mesh onto the `x,y` plane.

    gmsh_curve(f::Function, a, b; npts=100, meshsize = 0, tag=-1)

Create a curve in the current `gmsh` model given by `{f(t) : t ∈ (a,b) }` where
`f` is a function from `ℝ` to `ℝ^3`. The curve is approximated by C² b-splines
passing through `npts` equispaced in parameter space. If a `meshsize` is given,
`gmsh` will use it when meshing the curve.
