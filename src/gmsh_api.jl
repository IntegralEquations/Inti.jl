    import_mesh_from_gmsh_model(;[dim=3]) --> Î©, msh

Create a [`Domain`](@ref) and a [`LagrangeMesh`](@ref) from the current `gmsh`
model. Passing `dim=2` will create a two-dimensional mesh by projecting the
original mesh onto the `x,y` plane.

This function assumes that the *Gmsh* API has been initialized through
`gmsh.initialize`.
