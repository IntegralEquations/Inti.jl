"""
    svector(f,n)

Create an `SVector` of length n, computing each element as f(i), where i is the
index of the element.
"""
svector(f,n)=  ntuple(f,n) |> SVector

"""
    standard_basis_vector(k, ::Val{N})

Create an `SVector` of length N with a 1 in the kth position and zeros elsewhere.
"""
standard_basis_vector(k, n::Val{N}) where {N} = svector(i-> i == k ? 1 : 0, n)

"""
    ambient_dimension(x)

Dimension of the ambient space where `x` lives. For geometrical objects this can
differ from its [`geometric_dimension`](@ref); for example a triangle in `ℝ³`
has ambient dimension `3` but geometric dimension `2`, while a curve in `ℝ³` has
ambient dimension 3 but geometric dimension 1.
"""
function ambient_dimension end

"""
    geometric_dimension(x)

NNumber of degrees of freedom necessary to locally represent the geometrical
object. For example, lines have geometric dimension of 1 (whether in `ℝ²` or in
`ℝ³`), while surfaces have geometric dimension of 2.
