    single_double_layer(; op, target, source::Quadrature, compression,
    correction, derivative = false)

Construct a discrete approximation to the single- and double-layer integral operators for
`op`, mapping values defined on the quadrature nodes of `source` to values defined on the
nodes of `target`. If `derivative = true`, return instead the adjoint double-layer and
hypersingular operators (which are the generalized Neumann trace of the single- and
double-layer, respectively).

For finer control, you must choose a `compression` method and a `correction` method, as
described below.

# Compression

The `compression` argument is a named tuple with a `method` field followed by
method-specific fields. It specifies how the dense linear operators should be
compressed. The available options are:

  - `(method = :none, )`: no compression is performed, the resulting matrices
    are dense. This is the default, but not recommended for large problems.
  - `(method =:hmatrix, tol)`: the resulting operators are compressed using
    hierarchical matrices with an absolute tolerance `tol` (defaults to `1e-8`).
  - `(method = :fmm, tol)`: the resulting operators are compressed using the
    fast multipole method with an absolute tolerance `tol` (defaults to `1e-8`).

# Correction

The `correction` argument is a named tuple with a `method` field followed by
method-specific fields. It specifies how the singular and nearly-singular
integrals should be computed. The available options are:

  - `(method = :none, )`: no correction is performed. This is not recommended, as the
    resulting approximation will be inaccurate if the kernel is singular and source and
    target are not sufficiently far from each other.
  - `(method = :adaptive, maxdist, tol)`: correct interactions corresponding to entries of
    `target` and elements of `source` that are within `maxdist` of each other. The singular
    (including finite part) interactions are computed in polar coordinates, while the
    near-singular interactions are computing using an adaptive quadrature rule. The `tol`
    argument specifies the tolerance of the adaptive integration. See
    [`adaptive_correction`](@ref) for more details.
  - `(method = :dim, maxdist, target_location)`: use the density interpolation method to
    compute the correction. `maxdist` specifies the distance between source and target
    points above which no correction is performed (defaults to `Inf`). `target_location`
    should be either `:inside`, `:outside`, or `:on`, and specifies where the `target``
    points lie relative to the to the `source` curve/surface (which is assumed to be
    closed). When `target === source`, `target_location` is not needed. See
    [`bdim_correction`](@ref) and [`vdim_correction`] for more details.

"""
    volume_potential(; op, target, source::Quadrature, compression, correction)

Compute the volume potential operator for a given PDE.

## Arguments
- `op`: The PDE (Partial Differential Equation) to solve.
- `target`: The target domain where the potential is computed.
- `source`: The source domain where the potential is generated.
- `compression`: The compression method to use for the potential operator.
- `correction`: The correction method to use for the potential operator.

## Returns

The volume potential operator `V` that represents the interaction between the
target and source domains.

## Compression

The `compression` argument is a named tuple with a `method` field followed by
method-specific fields. It specifies how the dense linear operators should be
compressed. The available options are:

  - `(method = :none, )`: no compression is performed, the resulting matrices
    are dense.
  - `(method =:hmatrix, tol)`: the resulting operators are compressed using
    hierarchical matrices with an absolute tolerance `tol` (defaults to `1e-8`).
  - `(method = :fmm, tol)`: the resulting operators are compressed using the
    fast multipole method with an absolute tolerance `tol` (defaults to `1e-8`).

## Correction

The `correction` argument is a named tuple with a `method` field followed by
method-specific fields. It specifies how the singular and nearly-singular
integrals should be computed. The available options are:

  - `(method = :none, )`: no correction is performed. This is not recommented,
    as the resulting approximation will be inaccurate if the source and target
    are not sufficiently far apart.
  - `(method = :dim, maxdist, target_location)`: use the density interpolation
    method to compute the correction. `maxdist` specifies the distance between
    source and target points above which no correction is performed (defaults to
    `Inf`). `target_location` should be either `:inside`, `:outside`, or `:on`,
    and specifies where the `target`` points lie relative to the to the
    `source`'s boundary. When `target === source`, `target_location` is not
    needed.

## Details
The volume potential operator is computed by assembling the integral operator
`V` using the single-layer kernel `G`. The operator `V` is then compressed using
the specified compression method. If no compression is specified, the operator
is returned as is. If a correction method is specified, the correction is
computed and added to the compressed operator.
