#=
Routines for correcting the singular or nearly singular entries of an integral
operator based on:
    1. Identifying (a priori) the entries of the integral operator which need to
    be corrected. This is done based on distance between points/elements and
    analytical knowldge of the convergence rate of the quadrature and the
    underlying kernels
    2. Performing a change-of-variables to alleviate the singularity of the
    integrand
    3. Doing an adaptive quadrature on the new integrand using HCubature.jl

The specialized integration is precomputed on the reference element for each
quadrature node of the standard quadrature.

    adaptive_correction(iop::IntegralOperator; tol, maxdist = farfield_distance(iop; atol), maxsplit = 1000])

Given an integral operator `iop`, this function provides a sparse correction to
`iop` for the entries `i,j` such that the distance between the `i`-th target and
the `j`-th source is less than `maxdist`.

Choosing `maxdist` is a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The smaller
the value, the fewer corrections are needed, but this may compromise the
accuracy. For a *fixed* quadrature, the size of `maxdist` has to grow as the
tolerance `tol` decreases. The default `[farfield_distance(iop; tol)](@ref)
provides a heuristic to determine a suitable `maxdist`.

The correction is computed by using the [`adaptive_integration`](@ref) routine,
with a tolerance `atol` and a maximum number of subdivisions `maxsplit`; see
[`adaptive_integration`](@ref) for more details.

Similar to [`adaptive_integration`](@ref), but indicates that `f` has an

guaranteeing that `f` is never evaluated at `x̂ₛ`. Aditionally, a suitable
change of variables may be applied to alleviate the singularity and improve the
rate of convergence.
